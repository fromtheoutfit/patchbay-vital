# The runnable half of the verification gate: steps 1-6 of the gate every spec in this
# repository ends with (.claude/commands/agent-os/shape-spec.md, Task N). Steps 7-9 are
# judgment, recorded in the spec's shape.md: Docs (the documentation the change touches reads
# true), Version (the change under [Unreleased] in CHANGELOG.md) and the standards
# retrospective per agent-os/standards/base/process/standards-retrospective.md; nothing here can
# run them. The shape of the gate is agent-os/standards/base/process/verification-gate.md's.
# CI installs the locked toolchain and runs this same script, and checks nothing it does not
# (.github/workflows/gate.yml).
#
# Usage: scripts/gate.sh        (no arguments; any argument is usage, exit 2)
#
# Exit status: 0 when every step passed; 1 at the first step that fails, after a line
# "FAIL  step N/M: <reason>" on stderr naming it, whatever status the tool returned, so a
# failing step 1 is reported before step 2 has a chance to pass; 2 on usage, or when the
# repository root cannot be entered, each said on stderr with no step run.
#
# A step that reads files from the tree reads the files git lists (the rule in
# agent-os/standards/base/process/verification-gate.md, "One script"): the tracked files plus the
# untracked ones git does not ignore, in one git ls-files -z call, each path once (a path in merge
# conflict is in the index once per stage), so an ignored stray such as .DS_Store is never seen
# and a file a spec adds before it is staged is. Each listing is written to a file in a temporary
# directory and git's own status checked, since neither a pipe nor a process substitution keeps
# it: a listing git could not make (a corrupt index) fails its step by name rather than reading as
# an empty one. Step 1 first refuses a tree whose work-tree top is not the repository root, a copy
# without .git inside another repository included, so no step lists files against an outer
# repository; it asks git whether this is inside a work tree (git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
# is true, which it is not in .git/ or a bare repository, where --show-cdup is empty too) and
# whether it is the top (--show-cdup is empty), and compares no paths, since a path typed in
# another case, or spelled C:/ rather than /c/, names the same directory. Step 1 then refuses every
# tracked file a committed .gitignore matches under the paths the gate's listings read (git
# ls-files --cached --ignored --exclude-per-directory=.gitignore -- ., step 2 listing the whole
# tree: a file force-added, or added before its pattern), naming each under one FAIL line: git
# lists such a file though the repository says it is ignored, and a tool that reads .gitignore
# itself skips it. The .gitignore files read are the work tree's, so a clean clone of a commit
# answers from that commit's own, and an uncommitted edit to one can make a local run disagree with
# CI's clean checkout, the one that counts; .git/info/exclude and the global excludes file are the
# machine's and never count, and a file no step reads never fails the gate. A listed path missing
# from the disk, or a symlink to nothing, fails its step by name. Step 1 parses a file ending in
# .sh or starting with a bash shebang; any other
# file fails the step by name, since only shell scripts live under scripts/. Steps 2-4 give ruff
# and mypy git's list itself: the .py and .pyi files it lists (for mypy, those under src/ and
# tests/), as explicit paths, so git alone decides what .gitignore, .git/info/exclude and the
# global excludes file hide. pytest has no form that reads a list without also loading the
# conftest.py of each directory it collects from, so step 5 lets it walk tests/ (testpaths) and
# first refuses, by name, any .py file git ignores there, and an ignored conftest.py at the root,
# which pytest loads too: with nothing ignored for pytest to read, its walk reads only what git
# lists, and -p no:doctest on its command line keeps it from reading a test*.txt there. Step 5's
# listing keeps --exclude-standard: it guards what pytest reads on this machine, which those files
# are.
#
# Steps 2-5 run the Python toolchain: ruff format --check, ruff check, mypy and pytest, each as `uv
# run --locked <tool>` from the repository root. ruff, mypy and pytest are told by flag to read
# pyproject.toml alone (--config, --config-file, -c), so a ruff.toml, mypy.ini or pytest.ini beside
# it, or a ruff.toml below it, tracked or not, cannot replace the rule set. uv has no such flag that
# keeps [tool.uv] (--config-file takes only a uv.toml, --no-config drops required-version), so step
# 2 refuses a uv.toml at the root by name, tracked or not, before uv reads it. Pins: the tools are
# pinned exactly in the [dependency-groups] dev section of pyproject.toml, each with the date it was
# published, and resolved in uv.lock; uv itself is pinned by [tool.uv] required-version there. Step
# 2 opens with `uv sync --locked`, which installs exactly what uv.lock names into .venv (a package
# the lock does not name is removed, as in CI) and fails the step as the sync, before any tool runs,
# when the lockfile no longer matches pyproject.toml (it is never rewritten), when uv cannot read
# either file or build the package from them (a license-files entry with no file, say), or when the
# running uv is not the required version; so a pin edited without re-locking is a failure by name
# and the gate writes nothing but the ignored .venv and caches. uv only warns about a key or value
# it cannot use in [tool.uv] and goes on without it, so step 2 fails on that warning by name. The
# tools then run under --locked, a check the sync has already passed. The rule set each step reads
# is the [tool.*] sections of pyproject.toml, named in that file's header; a value ruff or pytest
# cannot parse fails its step. A pin or a rule is changed deliberately, in the gate's own spec
# (agent-os/standards/base/process/verification-gate.md), and the gate rerun.
#
# Step 1 needs bash, git and mktemp. Steps 2-5 need git, which lists their files and which uv calls
# to fetch patchbay-core from its [tool.uv.sources] commit, tee and grep, uv
# on PATH at the version [tool.uv] required-version pins (the one runtime this repository assumes;
# agent-os/standards/base/process/ownership.md) and, the first time, network access to fetch the
# locked packages into uv's cache and the interpreter .python-version names, uv-managed as [tool.uv]
# python-preference requires, into uv's Python directory. Step 6 needs git, cmp, comm, awk and sed,
# and the sibling checkout of patchbay-standards at ../patchbay-standards holding the commit pinned
# in agent-os/standards/base/.version (agent-os/standards/base/process/standards-sync.md). Nothing
# else is installed to run the gate.
