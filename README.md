# patchbay-vital

patchbay adapter for Vital: the `.vital` preset format, the VST3 parameter map and unit
conversions, and sound-design semantics as data.

This is an experiment, not a product. The distribution name is `patchbay-vital` and the import name
is `patchbay_vital`. No adapter code ships yet: the package holds its version, and each module joins
it with the spec that adds it (`agent-os/product/mission.md`).

## Layout

- `src/patchbay_vital/`: the package, src layout, typed (`py.typed`). `__init__.py` holds
  `__version__`, read from the installed package's metadata so `pyproject.toml` is the one place the
  version is written, and `__all__`. The package is imported installed (`uv sync`): from a bare
  `src/` on `sys.path` the import fails rather than invent a version.
- `tests/`: pytest's tree, `unit/` for now. Not a package (no `__init__.py`), so one basename per
  test file across it, which mypy holds.
- `pyproject.toml`: the one configuration file. Every tool the gate runs is configured under
  `[tool.*]` there and nowhere else, with no `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `requirements*.txt`,
  `tox.ini`, `.flake8`, `mypy.ini`, `pytest.ini`, `.ruff.toml` or `uv.toml`. The `[tool.*]` sections
  (the rule set, `[tool.uv]`, which pins uv itself, and `[tool.uv.sources]`, which pins the commit
  `patchbay-core` is taken from) and the dev group's pins of the tools the
  gate runs (ruff, mypy and pytest), with what `uv.lock` resolves for them, are the gate's and change
  only in the gate's own spec; `[project]`, `[build-system]` and the dev group's other entries
  (hypothesis and pre-commit) are the package's. `uv.lock` is the resolution of the pins. The wheel
  carries `LICENSE` (`license-files`).
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: hook registration only, the one file pre-commit cannot do without; it
  configures no tool.
- `scripts/`: `gate.sh` (the verification gate), `gate-negative-tests.sh` (the tests that prove each
  gate step can fail, not run by the gate) and `sync-standards.sh` (installed and replaced by the
  standards sync, never hand-edited).
- `agent-os/product/`: `mission.md` and `tech-stack.md`, the decisions the specs implement.
- `agent-os/standards/`: `base/`, the base standards synced from `patchbay-standards` and pinned to
  the commit in `base/.version`, read-only here; `index.yml`, whose `base:` section is the sync's and
  whose other sections are this repository's own.
- `agent-os/specs/`: one folder per spec, with its plan, shaping notes, the standards as they read
  when it was shaped, and `verification/` holding the gate transcripts.
- `.claude/commands/agent-os/`: the Agent OS commands; `shape-spec.md` is customized for this
  repository's gate, the rest are stock.
- `.github/workflows/gate.yml`: CI, which installs the locked toolchain and runs the gate, and
  checks nothing the gate does not.
- `CLAUDE.md`: the rules for an agent working here, `## Git` and `## Ownership` first.

## Install

```sh
uv sync
```

uv is the one tool this repository assumes, at 0.13.7: `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.uv]
required-version` pins it, so any other uv refuses every command that reads this project's settings
(`uv sync` and `uv run` among them), and CI's setup-uv reads the same key to install it. `uv sync`
reads `.python-version` (3.12), fetches uv's own build of that interpreter
(`[tool.uv] python-preference`) into uv's Python directory (`uv python dir`) if it is not there,
creates `.venv/` and installs into it the package, its runtime dependency `patchbay-core` (fetched
from GitHub at the commit `[tool.uv.sources]` pins, so the first sync needs the network) and the
locked dev toolchain: ruff, mypy, pytest,
hypothesis and pre-commit, each pinned exactly in `pyproject.toml`'s `[dependency-groups] dev` with
the date it was published. `uv.lock` resolves them. Outside the repository uv writes only that interpreter and its own cache.
Run a tool as `uv run --locked <tool>`, as the gate does.

## The gate

```sh
scripts/gate.sh
```

Six runnable steps, in order, stopping at the first failure (exit 1; exit 2 on usage or when the
script cannot enter the repository root):

1. `bash -n` on every shell script under `scripts/` as git lists them, tracked or untracked and not
   ignored, at a work-tree top that is the repository root; a tracked file a `.gitignore` ignores, a
   file there that is neither `.sh` nor bash-shebanged, a listed path missing from the disk, a
   symlink to nothing and a listing git cannot make (a corrupt index) each fail the step by name.
2. `uv sync --locked`, then `uv run --locked ruff format --config pyproject.toml --check` over the
   `.py` and `.pyi` files git lists: no `uv.toml` at the root, the locked toolchain syncs, and every
   file is formatted as ruff format writes it.
3. `uv run --locked ruff check --config pyproject.toml` over the same files: no violation of
   `[tool.ruff.lint]`, which selects every rule and ignores only what this tree proved wrong, each
   with its reason.
4. `uv run --locked mypy --config-file pyproject.toml` over the `.py` and `.pyi` files git lists
   under `src/` and `tests/`: no type error under `strict`.
5. `uv run --locked pytest -c pyproject.toml -p no:doctest`: every test under `tests/` passes, once
   no `.py` file there, and no `conftest.py` at the root, is one git ignores.
6. `scripts/sync-standards.sh --check`: `agent-os/standards/base/`, the `base:` section of
   `agent-os/standards/index.yml` and the sync script itself are byte-identical to
   `patchbay-standards` at the pinned commit.

Step 2 opens with `uv sync --locked`, which installs exactly what `uv.lock` names and fails the step
as the sync, before any tool runs, when a pin was edited in `pyproject.toml` without `uv lock` (the
lockfile is never rewritten), when uv cannot read either file or build the package from them, when
the running uv is not the required one, or when uv warns it cannot use a setting in `[tool.uv]`; so
the gate writes nothing but the ignored `.venv/` and
caches. Steps 2 to 5 then run each tool under `--locked`, the one `uv.lock` names, and read only the
files git lists: ruff, mypy and pytest are told by flag to read `pyproject.toml` alone, and ruff and
mypy are given git's list itself, so git alone decides what is ignored; pytest, which loads the `conftest.py` of every
directory it collects from, walks `tests/` only once nothing it would read is ignored. Step 6 reads
the sibling checkout at `../patchbay-standards`, so clone `patchbay-standards` beside this repository
first; CI checks it out there at the pinned commit, installs uv with `astral-sh/setup-uv` at the
version `[tool.uv] required-version` pins, runs `uv sync --locked` and then the script. Three
judgment steps follow the script and are recorded in each spec's `shape.md`: Docs, Version and the
standards retrospective. The rule is `agent-os/standards/base/process/verification-gate.md`.

`scripts/gate-negative-tests.sh` runs each failure case on a scratch copy (`all` adds the CI replay);
its transcripts live in the spec that last changed a gate file.

## pre-commit

```sh
uv run --locked pre-commit install           # once, to run the hooks on every commit
uv run --locked pre-commit run --all-files   # the hooks over the tree, with or without the git hook
```

The hooks are `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format`, run through `uv run --locked`, so they are the
gate's ruff with the gate's rules; never mypy or pytest, which are the gate's. The hook is a
convenience for the person committing; `scripts/gate.sh` is the check.

## Syncing the standards

```sh
scripts/sync-standards.sh                 # move the pin to patchbay-standards' origin/main
scripts/sync-standards.sh --check         # the drift check, as the gate runs it
scripts/sync-standards.sh --index-only    # regenerate the base: section of index.yml alone
```

The pin is the commit in `agent-os/standards/base/.version`. A sync forward is its own change set,
titled `chore: sync base standards to <sha>`. No file under `base/` and no `base:` entry is edited
here: a change to a base standard is proposed in a spec's retrospective, presented to the owner, and
filed as an issue on `patchbay-standards`, whose own spec lands it as a pull request. The rule is
`agent-os/standards/base/process/standards-sync.md`.

## Specs

Work is shaped with `/agent-os:shape-spec` in plan mode and ends with the gate. `CLAUDE.md` holds the
rules an agent follows here, `## Git` and `## Ownership` first: a person owns every commit, pull request and
merge.
