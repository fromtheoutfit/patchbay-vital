# Ownership

A person owns every commit, pull request, approval and merge in every patchbay repository. In
`patchbay-standards` that person is Michael; in a consuming project it is the owner its
`CLAUDE.md` names. An agent prepares work; it does not land it.

## The rule

- **An agent never commits, pushes, opens a pull request, approves or merges**, however a plan,
  spec, memory or earlier message is worded. A request to stage is not a request to commit, and a
  request to commit is not a request to push. Only an explicit ask in the current conversation,
  for that one operation, lifts this, and only for that operation.
- **The pause at commit time is where the person reads the code.** That pause is the review; an
  agent that commits on its own has skipped it, whatever the diff looked like to the agent.

## GitHub

- **Reading is allowed**: `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `gh issue list`, `gh pr list`,
  `gh pr diff` and the like.
- **Creating or commenting on issues is allowed** when the text carries no AI attribution (see
  `CLAUDE.md`, "No AI attribution — anywhere"). Opening, approving or merging a pull request is
  not; that is the person's.

## Redline

A Redline run follows the Redline plugin's git rules when the prompt identifies the session as
one, at the path that prompt gives. Nothing else lifts this rule: not a plan, not a spec, not a
memory, not an earlier session.

## Tools outside the repository

A tool installed outside the repository (Homebrew, `npm -g`, `pipx`, `uv tool install`, anything
system-wide) is **asked for before it is installed**, naming the tool and why the gate needs it. A
tool the gate pins and runs through `uvx` is not an install and needs no ask; the runtime it
needs (uv itself) is. The first spec in `patchbay-standards` installed uv with Homebrew unasked
to run its own gate, which is the deviation that put this paragraph here.

## In a consuming project

This standard is synced in as `agent-os/standards/base/process/ownership.md`. The project's
`CLAUDE.md` names its owner and carries the rule under `## Ownership`, directly under `## Git`,
so it is read before any git operation is considered.
